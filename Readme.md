# Organization

The structure of this project follows my [template-javascript](https://github.com/dschnare/template-javascript) project. Rake is used as the build system to compile all JavaScript modules and to test all source files via [jslint](http://www.jslint.com/). To see all the Rake tasks run `rake -D`.

In the `web` directory you will find a simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) application that can be used for testing (although it isn't necessary since you can run the index.html page by opening it in your web browser).


# Installing

After installing the **Build System Requirements** you can install Sinatra and Foreman by running:

`bundle install`

To run the Sinatra application:

Unix/Linux: `foreman start`
Windows: `bundle exec ruby -Cweb app.rb -p 5000`

Then point your browser to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
